# read_PDC_netCDF

This GitHub repository contains the python code as a jupyter notebook to open and plot the netCDF files containing the inverted density and susceptibility distribution in the area of the Transantarctic Mountains and Wilkes Subglacial Basin as well as the input and inverted gravity and magnetic data. The data sets are published through the UK Polar Data centre https://www.bas.ac.uk/data/uk-pdc/. The research article related to the data is submitted to the JGR solid earth and the preprint can be accessed at: https://essopenarchive.org/doi/full/10.22541/essoar.168987130.08453761/v1
